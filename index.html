      <h2>Lost Man</h2>
      <p> Jos√© Salvador Alvarenga was a fisherman in Mexico who planned a trip in 2012 with a friend for two days, but it all went wrong within hours. Alvarenga and his boat partner would end up out at sea for 438 days, 
      and then he would be alone after 3 months out at sea.
